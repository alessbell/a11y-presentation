# Intro to Web a11y

Front-end Knowledge Exchange, Jan '21

</Cover>

---

# Overview

1. What is `a11y`?
1. `a11y` basics
1. How to test a11y

<SpeakerNotes>

First, let's make sure we have a shared definition of a11y.

What is accessibility as a concept? What does it mean on the web?

a11y basics + best practices

testing: how to we build an accessible web as we're developing, and how do we keep it that way and prevent regressions?

</SpeakerNotes>

---

# 1. What is `a11y`?

**Web accessibility** means that **people with disabilities** can **use** and **understand** the web

<SpeakerNotes>Numeronym for accessibility</SpeakerNotes>

---

## Why?

1. It's a basic human right
1. It's required by law
1. It's good for business ([WCAG business case](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#is-there-a-business-case-for-accessibility))
1. It's good UX

<SpeakerNotes>

Many of us on this call may already be convinced of the benefits of good accessibility practices, but it's important to understand what the stakes are

Front-end engineers, we already have a lot on our plates:

- a lot of new stuff to keep up with, JS language features + browser APIs, new testing frameworks, new patterns...
- why do we need to be concerned with a11y too?

- It's important that we don't violate anyone's human rights, that we meet our legal obligations, that we maximize our total adressable market + customer base, but it also improves the experience for all users regardless of ability

## It's required by law (cont'd)

> Today, internet technology enables individuals to participate actively in their community and engage in commerce from the comfort and convenience of their home. It would be a cruel irony to adopt the interpretation of the ADA espoused by Blick, which would render the legislation intended to emancipate the disabled from the bonds of isolation and segregation obsolete when its objective is increasingly within reach.
>
> <cite>
>   EDNY Judge Jack Weinstein in Andrews v. Blick Art Materials, 2017 (
>   <a href="https://www.lflegal.com/2017/08/ny-web-cases/" target="_blank">
>     source
>   </a>
>   )
> </cite>

<SpeakerNotes>

The web is this amazing utility that allows us to connect in communities, engage in commerce - this judge is saying "why would we exclude the web from meeting this burden of accessibility when it's increasingly within reach?"

Human rights:
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is an international human rights treaty. The CRPD defines access to technology like the Web as a basic human right.

Required by law:
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - it has been reaffirmed in the courts as applying to websites time and time again

## It's good UX

<SpeakerNotes>
One of my favorite examples of good a11y resulting in better experience for everyone is [Google Maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6396990?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)

This makes the UX better for everyone:

- disabled folks who would otherwise be permanently unable to use this app without this feature
- people who temporarily or situationally find themselves benefitting from this UX pattern

But I use this all the time if I'm carrying heavy groceries for example and trying to navigate one-handed, or a new parent as we saw in the previous slide

# 2. `a11y` basics

## (that aren't always so basic)

---

## The **World Wide Web Consortium** ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/)) maintains the

## **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines** ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/))

---

- The goal of WCAG is to provide a single shared standard for web accessibility

- The latest standard is **WCAG 2.1**

- **WCAG 2.2** is scheduled to be published in 2021 ([what's new](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/))

- WCAG is a **technical standard**, not an introduction to accessibility

<SpeakerNotes>
  - The latest standard is **WCAG 2.1**, published on June 5, 2018

- [WCAG 2.1 focuses on four guiding principles, "**POUR**"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/)
  - PERCEIVABLE
  - OPERABLE
  - UNDERSTANDABLE
  - ROBUST

  height="800"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>

- Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive the information being presented. It cannot be imperceptible to all their senses
- Operable: Users must be able to operate the interface. The interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform
- Understandable: Users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface. The content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding
- Robust: Users must be able to access content as technologies advance. As technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible

> All automated tools, including WAVE, have limitation‚Äîonly 25% to 35% of possible conformance failures can be automatically detected. Absence of detectable errors does not indicate that a site is accessible or compliant.

# Barriers to shipping accessible web apps

## via Amberley Romo @ amberley.dev ([source](https://amberley.dev/blog/2020-02-05-gatsby-days-la-a11y-unconference-notes/))

- Remembering to use tools in the development process
- Deciding what "good enough" means
- Too many ambiguous and distributed sources of information

<SpeakerNotes>

- As a developer without disabilities, they have direct visual feedback in the course of developing -- remembering to test and bring it outside perspectives.
- Sometimes we think a site/experience is inaccessible, when the issue might be a developer's lack of familiarity/dexterity with a11y tools like screen readers
- There aren't any complete resources for what makes something accessible, because it's so nuanced
- The standards say what something should do, but not how, the path is not always clear

## Maybe we don't need JS? üßê

<SpeakerNotes>Should our site work without JavaScript?</SpeakerNotes>

## Many examples of good accessible design patterns practices from the WCAG contain JS!

**JavaScript is essential for many accessible patterns. Misusing it is the problem, just like with HTML.**

<SpeakerNotes>
  Context: it dependsTM -- some government sites must be accessible without JS
  and often have to deal with the most constraints

```js
// Bind keyboard behaviors on the main accordion container
accordion.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
  var key = event.which.toString();
  // 33 = Page Up, 34 = Page Down
  var ctrlModifier = event.ctrlKey && key.match(/33|34/);

  // Is this coming from an accordion header?
  if (event.target.classList.contains("Accordion-trigger")) {
    // 38 = Up, 40 = Down
    if (key.match(/38|40/) || ctrlModifier) {
      var index = triggers.indexOf(event.target);
      var direction = key.match(/34|40/) ? 1 : -1;
      var length = triggers.length;
      var newIndex = (index + length + direction) % length;

      triggers[newIndex].focus();
    }
  }
});
```

---

```js
// Up/ Down arrow and Control + Page Up/ Page Down keyboard operations
else if (key.match(/35|36/)) {
      // 35 = End, 36 = Home keyboard operations
      switch (key) {
        // Go to first accordion
        case "36":
          triggers[0].focus();
          break;
        // Go to last accordion
        case "35":
          triggers[triggers.length - 1].focus();
          break;
      }
      event.preventDefault();
    }
```

Basics/"low hanging fruit":

- https://a11y.coffee/quick-wins/#4-missing-form-input-labels
- focus order
- links vs. buttons??? `role="button"` (https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role/software-engineer-or-frontend-developer)
- heading hierarchy (why? so users can scan the headings to zoom in on what they're looking for/care about)
- inputs + labels
- keyboard focus
- links make sense out of context

---

Advanced topics:

- Sessions (unexpectedly logging users out)
- Trap focus in modals
- Announce dynamic content: aria-live
- SPA advanced topics ([Gatsby user testing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/))
  - Without page refreshes, screen reader users may not be informed that the page has changed
  - On client-side page transitions, focus to the top of the application (i.e. a parent wrapper element) to mimic a traditional browser refresh and announce new content in assistive technology

# 3. How to test `a11y`

# Tools for automatic error detection:

- Axe,
  ... etc

https://madalyn.dev/blog/a11y-testing-coffee/

- navigating with your keyboard
- using a screen reader: skimming https://web.archive.org/web/20160916181038/http://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader#linearization
- turning your screen magnification way up (300%+)
- using a site with audio muted
- verifying that the prefers reduced motion setting is respected
